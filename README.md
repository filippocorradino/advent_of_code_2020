AoC 2020 (https://adventofcode.com/2020)

This year will again be in Python 3.8.2
Next year I'll try out Rust, perhaps

#### Current progress


```markdown
| Day | 1 | 2 | Language |
|-----|---|---|----------|
| 01  |   |   |  Python  |
```


#### Target
* Simple and readable code, as pythonic as I can make it
* Readability and versatility over efficiency
* No dependencies outside standard library
* Finish AoC 2020 before AoC 2021
